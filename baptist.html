            On April 1, 1891, Daniel Winesberry, a 72 years-old African American wagon maker, sold part of this lot to
            the trustees of the “colored Primitive Baptists” for one dollar. The portion sold was on the north corner
            of the lot, facing Main Street and was “129 feet by 38 feet deep”. According to the deed, Winesberry sold
            this portion of his lot to the trustees “for the purpose of Erecting a house of Worship for the above named
            Primitive Denomination of Baptists.” This information, in addition to the “1891” corner stone on the
            west-southwest side of the church, leads to the deduction that a church was built within a year after the
            land was purchased from Winesberry. This chapel was also used temporarily as the schoolhouse for local
            African American students when their Rosenwald school building was burned in 1939.
