            This large, two-story log house was built under the ownership of the Lewis Stephens family. It is
            prominently located on the crest of the ridge that runs parallel and west of Germain Street. When viewed
            from the intersection of Main and Filbert Streets, it sets slightly south of the extended line of Filbert
            Street. The original front of this house is viewed best from Filbert Street. A carved stone in one of the
            gable-end chimneys dates the construction of the house to 1788. The house sits within a larger tract that
            Lewis Stephens Sr., had reserved when he platted the original in-lots and out-lots of the town in 1758. The
            "1788" date stone in the chimney of this house precedes the sale of this property to its next owner by ten
            years and places the house in the ownership of the Stephens' family when it was built. A reconstruction of
            the plat, based on the meets and bounds of the various other deeds that made up the 25 1/8-acre tract,
            clearly indicates that the two-story log house is the structure referred to in one deed as the “mansion
            house.” This house was built within the northwest corner of the 3 ½-acre “mansion” tract. It was certainly
            the house that Lewis Stephens Jr. and his wife lived in prior to moving to his father’s home, the house he
            would inherit upon his father’s death, in 1802. Bell Air later became the home of Revolutionary War veteran
            and Methodist minister John Bell Tilden sometime between 1801 and 1815. This is the only remaining house
            within the town’s boundaries owned and built by the family of the town’s founder Lewis Stephens Sr.
