<p>In the decades after the Civil War this was one of two cemeteries established on land that was once the town’s common, a tract originally held in reserve by the town’s proprietor Lewis Stephens. The African American population of the town and its African American suburb to the east, called Crossroads or Freetown, buried their dead here in this cemetery. It includes the grave of Cornelia Barbour Turner Avery (1867-1927), a noted midwife and matriarch of the town’s African American community. This cemetery remains in active use.
