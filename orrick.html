            Initially the African American Methodists worshipped with their fellow Methodists of European descent at
            the Methodist meeting house on Main Street. By the 1850s tensions over slavery and the theological beliefs
            that justified slavery were causing a division in the townâ€™s Methodist congregation along racial lines. The
            African American Methodist congregation constructed their own meeting house near this spot during the
            1850s. During the late autumn of 1864 Federal troops took down this first meeting house and used the
            building materials to construct their winter quarters at Camp Russell to the north of town. After the war
            the African American Methodists in town build this chapel with the help of a former slave named Robert
            Orrick (ca. 1827-1902) who owned a successful livery stable business in Winchester, Virginia. Robert Orrick
            was also a preacher and leader in the local African American Methodist community. With the financial help
            of Reverend Orrick, the African American Methodists of Newtown built this house of worship and named it
            Orrick Chapel in honor of their benefactor.

            As the nineteenth century ended, the white leadership of the Methodist Episcopal Church increasingly
            sanctioned racial segregation as a form of discrimination, a process that culminated with the imposition of
            racial segregation on Methodist congregations in 1936. Nevertheless, the national church continued to
            discuss and debate race relations in the church, and in 1968, the church began to enforce integration
            throughout the United States. The merger of Orrick Chapel with Stephens City United Methodist Church in
            1991 represents the culmination of this late twentieth century trend. Its trustees donated Orrick Chapel to
            the Stone House Foundation in 1993 and the African American Methodists once
