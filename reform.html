            In her book <em> Early Days and Methodism in Stephens City, Virginia </em> Inez Virginia Steele wrote in
            1906 the following about the Lutheran chapel that once stood on this site between Mulberry Street and the
            Lutheran graveyard:
        </p>

        <blockquote>The first church was a log structure and was probably built some half dozen years or more before
            the Methodist Church. By what agreement with the Reformed congregation is unknown, but the record shows
            that the Lutherans commenced worshipping in the church in 1786 jointly with the Reformed, each society
            having its own pastor. “In 1812 or ’13 the old log church was torn down and a brick one built with a
            steeple and excellent bell. This was done principally by Lutherans.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This brick church was remodeled and enlarged in 1851. During the Civil War it was used as a field hospital
            following the Battle of Cedar Creek and, after the war, it had to be repaired at considerable cost. In
            1883, after being struck by lightning the previous summer, the cupola (steeple) and roof were repaired, and
            other renovations were completed. It was at that time that new gothic windows were installed, and other
            interior alterations were accomplished. This chapel was torn down when the current church building was
            erected in 1906. Since then this site has been vacant.
        </p>

            The graveyard has the remains of veterans of the Revolutionary War and Civil War as well as some of the
            town’s prominent wagon makers and their spouses.
